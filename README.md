Overview
Building a system for business insights & analysis using Natural Language Processing of customer dialogs & participating in Project Planning, Data Operations, Model Engineering, Machine Learning, Visualization while using at all production stages:

SQL (extract, organize data from customer conversations on Facebook Fan Page),

Python (conduct Exploratory Data Analysis to refine, pre-process datasets, use SQLAlchemy as Object Relation Mapper on Virtual Environment to request data from API server available on Postman, read, insert CSV files, translate Python classes, load large data to created tables on the relational database, handle large-scale datasets efficiently by Batch Processing)

MySQL-like TablePlus (create & design tables in this MySQL-like Relational Database for receiving datasets from Python & execute SQL queries),

Tableau (visualize refined datasets for insights of customer sentiments, trends, patterns of customer behaviors, buying motives, etc,...),

Docker (run & manage applications),

Flask (route web traffic through HTTP requests to specific functions in the code base),

SQLAlchemy (make the interaction between Python and our database smoother),

Flask-SQLAlchemy (make the interaction between Flask and SQLAlchemy smoother).

Courtesy:
This project was conducted by me during my last remote internship for the Center of Talent in AI (CoTAI), Sai Gon, Vietnam from Toronto, Canada. Hereby, I thank Mr. Hung Ngo - Founder of CoTAI and Mr. Huy Le - my supervisor there who had provided support, vision, guidance through this project. The private content of this dataset had been hidden and transformed to avoid data leakage so I could upload it to my e-portoflio as a proof of work experience. This project can also be upgraded, expanded as per my noted Room for Enhancement below.

Targets & Achievements:
An online retail business should be able to use their vast amounts of data and information in such a way that impacts the business, including:

Tracking customer & sales activites

Identifying purchase habits

Detecting user trends and patterns

Recommending purchases

Determining price optimizations

Identifying potential & complaining customers

Room for Enhancement:
Applying LODs (Level of Details) in Tableau to establish new variables to improve performance, readability and troubleshoot multiple steps in the analysis:
--> How long to get the confirmation

--> Statistics for each customer

--> Performance of each Fan Page

--> Address: which living area generates more online shopping activities

--> When confirming the transaction, what do customers usually talk to Sales team?

--> What do customers say to start their conversations, ask about products, ask for promotions?

Creating new columns from the original dataset for further combined analysis

Generating geographical columns from customer dialogs to analyze based on customer's shipping address (city, region, district, ward)

Conducting Predictive Analysis to predict future trend based on timeline from Tableau's Machine Learning, Prescriptive Analysis to determine which actions should be taken to achieve a goal or target (this may require more business numerical columns provided by the stakeholders to execute), Cognitive Analysis to learn what might happen if circumstances change and determine how we might handle these situations.

Creating the dashed horizontal line denoting a certain percentile of daily sales for the period shown

Creating a reference line to show which customers are above the median purchases and employees are above the median sales target (if this variable is provided later) by making a percentile line by using the measure and set the percentile to an expected percentage.
